These coding projects are for the C++ arduino script for an Arduino Uno circuit and a Python script for an ESP32 board 


Servo_Keypad
-----
The code is imported onto a circuit board(UNO), the board is connected to the corrseponding components on the declared Pin I/O's including a keypad

The user must input the correct 3-character password and the servo motor attached will open a door lock that the circuit is also attached to 

if the password is incorrect the red light will show and the door will remain locked 


Visual example of the circuit working can be found here:

Reset Counter
-----

Again the code is imported onto the circuit board(ESP32), the display will show the output of the running code which is a counter that goes to 10 and resets, the code can be modified for any time limit and reset requirements

Joystick Control
-----

Again the code is imported onto the circuit board(UNO), a joystick and 4 leds are attached, when the user moves the joystick across an X/Y axis, the leds will switch on accordingly, this will indicate to the user which direction the joystick has been moved
