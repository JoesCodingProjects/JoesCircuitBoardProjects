This coding project is the C++ arduino script for an Arduino Uno circuit board 

The code is imported onto a circuit board, the board is connected to the corrseponding components on the declared Pin I/O's including a keypad

The user must input the correct 3-character password and the servo motor attached will open a door lock that the circuit is also attached to 

if the password is incorrect the red light will show and the door will remain locked 


Visual example of the circuit working can be found here:
